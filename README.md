Q1: Why are readme's in github in the .md format? What is .md and why does github
use it instead of .txt, .html .docx, or any other file format?

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)

Q2: Is the keyword "fixes" the only way to auto-close an issue from a PR
(pull request). Is there other keywords that can accomplish the same thing?

> `close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolve, resolved` can also being used for auto-close an issue

Q3: Do you have to create a new PR EVERYTIME you want to close an issue,
or is it possible to close multiple issues within a single PR? If so,
how?

> Yes you can fix multiple issues in one PR. You can just nested them in the message box.
