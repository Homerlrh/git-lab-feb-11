Q1: Why are readme's in github in the .md format? What is .md and why does github
    use it instead of .txt, .html .docx, or any other file format?
    
Q2: Is the keyword "fixes" the only way to auto-close an issue from a PR 
    (pull request). Is there other keywords that can accomplish the same thing?
    
Q3: Do you have to create a new PR EVERYTIME you want to close an issue,
    or is it possible to close multiple issues within a single PR? If so, 
    how?
